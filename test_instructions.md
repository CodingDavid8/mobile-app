# How To Test

Thanks for willing to test our mobile app!

If this is your first time launching the app, create a new wallet or import one. Your private key will be encrypted and saved automatically on the local storage of your device. Afterwards, you don't need to login again as long as you don't uninstall the app.

Once you finished the wallet setup, you should be redirected to the swap screen. You can press & hold on your wallet adress in the upper left corner in order to copy your public address to your clipboard.

> The test APK is running only on the rinkeby **TEST** network - no real ETH will be used!

Use https://faucet.rinkeby.io to get some test ether and switch back to the app and try around to swap between different coins. You can also customize the gas limit etc.
